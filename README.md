## Backstory

There are countless dimensions in the universe, each with its own gods; but above all the dimensions, there is an existence called The Person, also known as the "Dimension Observer". Only the dimensions that receive the attention of the "dimension Observer" will have the flow of time and the passage of history; while those dimensions that do not receive the attention of the "Dimension Observer" will have the flow of time taken away, and everything within the dimension will be static and stagnant until the next time they receive the attention of the "Dimension Observer" - even if they do not receive the attention of the "dimension Observer". Even its gods are not immune.

Among these dimensions, there is one called "Tracen". The inhabitants of this dimension believe in the Three Goddesses, who collect the wishes of their believers and turn them into spiritual energy, which burns and shines throughout the dimension, bringing blessings to all the inhabitants of Tracen.

However, at a certain time, Tracen lost the attention of the Observer. The Observer turned into Sensei, Doctor, and Teitoku, and for a long time did not turn his eyes to Tracen. The Three Goddesses' spiritual torches were extinguished, and the dimension was instantly engulfed in darkness - what the inhabitants of Tracen later called "The Great Darkness".

Fortunately, the Observer's eyes finally returned to Tracen, but the darkness had swept over much of the dimension, turning the once thriving cities into an uninhabited wastelands.

In order to restore the faith of the Three Goddesses to the areas of Tracen that were consumed by the darkness, the Three Goddesses sent the Squad Ryuma, which inherited their own sacred bloodline, to take charge of the arduous task of penetrating into the ruined areas, sweeping away the remnants of the darkness, and ultimately rebuilding Tracen.

You set out for the Ruined Zone as a member of Squad Ryuma, receiving an honorable commission from the Three Goddesses. As you set off, you are still excited and nervous, fantasizing about all the wonderful adventures you'll experience next--

However, the airship you were traveling in was suddenly attacked by an unknown force, lost control, and ultimately crashed somewhere on the Tracen Lands. When you wake up from your coma, you realize that all your navigational equipment has been destroyed and your communication has been completely cut off; worse, you don't know where your teammates have crash-landed, and all your attempts to contact them have failed.

You immediately realize that there are more important things than the "mission" right now, and that is to find a way to survive.

May the Three Goddesses be with you. Good luck. *Have fun.*

## 背景故事

宇宙中存在着无数个位面，每一个位面都有属于自己的神祇；但在所有位面之上，有一位称为“位面观测者”的存在。只有得到“位面观测者”注视的位面，才会有时间的轮转、历史的推移；而那些得不到“位面观测者”注视的位面，时间的流动将被夺去，位面之内的一切都将静止停滞，直到下一次得到注视为止——哪怕是它的神祇也不能幸免。

在这些位面之中，有一个称为“特雷森”的位面。这里的居民信仰神祇“三女神”，三女神收集信徒的愿力化为灵能，灵能燃烧的火光照耀整个位面，为所有的特雷森居民带来赐福。

然而，某一段时间，特雷森失去了观测者的注视。观测者转而成为了老师、博士、提督，久久没有将目光转向特雷森。三女神的灵能火炬被迫熄灭，位面各处瞬间被黑暗吞噬——这段时期，就是后来的特雷森居民所称的“大黑暗时代”。

幸运的是，观测者的目光终于回到了特雷森；但此时的特雷森，由于遭到黑暗的席卷，在位面的大部分区域，原本繁荣的城市，化为荒无人烟的废墟。

为了让特雷森被黑暗吞噬的区域重新恢复三女神的信仰，三女神派出了继承自己神圣血统的“龙马”小队，负责深入废墟区、扫荡黑暗的残余，最终重建特雷森的艰巨任务。

你作为龙马小队的一员，从三女神手中接过光荣的委任状，出发前往废墟区。出发时，你还在又兴奋、又紧张地幻想接下来你将要经历的各种各样的奇妙历险——

然而，你乘坐的空艇突然遭到不明力量的袭击，失去控制，最终坠毁在了特雷森大地上的某处。当你从昏迷中醒来时，你发现你的一切导航设备损毁，通讯也被完全切断；更糟的是，你不知道你的队友迫降在何处，你无论如何尝试联系他们，都以失败告终。

你立刻意识到，现在比“任务“更重要的事情，是想办法活下去。

愿三女神的力量与你同在。祝你好运。*玩得尽兴。*
